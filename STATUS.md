### NavRail Order
MAP → EXPLORE → INTEL → WORLD → TRAJ → VENDORS → PRODS → SWEEP → OPPS → IKER → RFP → OPS → STATUS

## What's Real vs Hardcoded
- **Real (Supabase)**: DECIDE queries, industry profiles, intel signals
- **Real (API pipeline)**: TODAY live signals, Industry signals with keyword fallback, WORLD signal dots, Sweep Google News
- **Hardcoded**: El Paso vendors (178KB), technology catalog (80 techs), country-tech map, conferences (1,005), industry stories
- **nxt-brain scans**: Writes to intel_signals → consumed by TODAY, Industry, WORLD, Key Players

## Pruning History
- Session 1 (2026-03-22): Deleted 14 routes (auth, command, dashboard, enter, innovation, marketplace, notes, ops, problems, product, radar, simulate, timeline, universe)
- Session 2 (2026-03-22): Deleted 7 routes (signals→intel, solve→industry/solve, store→products, compare, companies, status→platform/status, ask)
- Session 3 (2026-03-22): Deleted /industries (→/explore)
- Total: 22 routes deleted, 30 remain

## Next Priorities
1. Deploy and verify production data flow end-to-end
2. Real-time signal streaming (WebSocket/SSE) — WorldMonitor gap
3. Signal severity escalation with visual urgency tiers
4. Cross-signal correlation (thread signals into narratives)
5. Timeline scrubbing (see signals over time)
6. Upgrade sweep to persist discoveries to Supabase

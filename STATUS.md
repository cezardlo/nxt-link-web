## What's Real vs Hardcoded
- **Real (Supabase)**: DECIDE queries, industry profiles (if DB populated), intel signals
- **Real (API pipeline)**: TODAY shows live signals, Industry pages fetch from intel-signals with fallback, WORLD maps signal dots
- **Hardcoded**: El Paso vendors (178KB), technology catalog (80 techs), country-tech map, conferences (86), industry stories
- **nxt-brain scans**: Writes to intel_signals in Supabase → consumed by TODAY, Industry, WORLD pages

## Next Priorities
1. Connect /signals page to real nxt-brain output (full signal browser)
2. Add user preferences / personalization (saved industries, followed signals)
3. Deploy and verify production data flow end-to-end
